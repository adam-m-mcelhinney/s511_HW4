### Stat 511 HW 4 #12
# Suppose X~Unif(0;1). Use Monte Carlo integration to approximate the
# moment-generating function M_X(u) of X on the interval u in (-2,2). Draw
# a plot of your approximation with the true mgf overlaid and remark on the
# quality of the approximation. 
# [Hints: 
# (i) T = 1000 Monte Carlo samples should be enough; 
# (ii) you can use the same Monte Carlo samples for each point u on the discrete grid.]
